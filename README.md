# PHY539 Project

A Github repository containing my course project for PHY539 (Introduction to Quantum Field Theory).

This project involved the study of Quantum Electrodynamics alongside the associated Feynmann diagrams in order to caclulate the muon g-2 factor.

The PDF file titled "QFT Project Report" is the final report that was submitted.

The ZIP file titled contains all of the LaTeX code for the project.

The PDF file titled "QFT Project Presentation" is the presentation that was made for presenting the project to the professor.
